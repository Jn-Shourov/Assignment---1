        "Throughout our history, Bangladesh has stood firmly in support of the Palestinian cause. We consistently
        condemned the illegal occupation and the violent repression carried out by Israel. We remain steadfast in
        advocating a just and lusting solution, through a two-State solution to the crisis, with Israel and Palestine
        living side by side in peace and harmony. Plaestine has to emerge as a fully independent and viable State base
        on the pre-1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as it's capital."
